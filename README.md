##Find The Song
It brings me so much joy to present to you my first personal project. 
If you are a book nerd you must know that many authors include the name of some song expecting their reader to listen to them while they read to create an incredible immersive experience. That leads the fans to create Spotify playlists with every song in the books, but we can all agree that it can be tough to collect every single song, especially in long books, that's when I thought of creating this program.
Find The Song is a program where you upload your favourite books in a pdf format and it finds every single song in the book and automatically creates a playlist in your Spotify profile. 

#DISCLAIMER
This is a work in progress, the program is not nearly done. It is also my first time coding in python so it might take a while but I invite you to stay tunned and of course any kind of advice is more than welcome.
